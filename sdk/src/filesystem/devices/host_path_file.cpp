 * Split large direct reads into pieces of this many MB. 0 = a single call.
 *
 * The worst case measured is a pread() of 19,932,032 bytes that takes 261.5 ms (there are 7 reads
 * over 8 MB, 169.2 ms on average). During those 261 ms the thread passes no point where the
 * scheduler can cleanly switch it out, and the per-file lock of XFile (file_lock_) stays held the
 * whole time.
 *
 * The cost of splitting can be bounded with the same data: fitting time = fixed + bytes/rate over
 * the 4.00 MB reads (59.8 ms on average, 21 samples) and the 19.01 MB reads (275.6 ms, 2 samples)
 * gives rate = 69.5 MB/s and fixed = 2.3 ms per call. So splitting 19 MB into 4 MB pieces is 4
 * extra calls = +9 ms over 275 (+3 %); 1 MB pieces would be 18 extra = +41 ms (+15 %). Hence 4
 * and not 1.
 *
 * In exchange, the worst pread drops from 261 ms to about 60, and short reads from the file system
 * are no longer visible: the loop keeps asking from where it stopped and only stops when a piece
 * returns 0 bytes (real end of file). The unsplit path returned the short read as it was.
 *
 * Measured: this does not raise FPS. Reads run on a thread other than the render thread, and outside
 * loading screens there is no correlation between slow reads and stutters. It is on because it
 * bounds the worst case and fixes short reads, not because a gain is expected.

 * RAM read cache by blocks (switch_io_cache_mb). Off: on the console it does the opposite of what it promises.

 * It is meant for a game that streams per zone pack: on leaving a zone it releases the whole pack and asks for it
 * again on entering, so most of what it reads from the SD has been read before, and its memory manager cannot be
 * told no. The only remedy is to make the second read not cost a trip to the SD. The cache keeps 256 KB blocks in an LRU and reads missing blocks grouped, in a single pread per contiguous
 * range, so a first read costs the same as without it; only read-only devices and files opened without write
 * access go through it.
 *
 * On the console it reads more than it saves. When a game asks for more unique data than fits, the LRU evicts nonstop, and each 256 KB block is
 * brought in to serve a small request and thrown away before it is reused. It also blocks: g_cache_mutex is a
 * single mutex for all files, held during the disk read, so every other reading thread waits behind it, and that
 * wait does not show in `[io] 15 s`, which only times inside read(). The range cache below replaces it.

/*
 * Read cache by exact range (switch_io_ranges_mb), the replacement for the block cache above.
 *
 * Why. A streamed pack that the game releases and asks for again, at the same offset and with the same size, is a
 * slow reread of a large file, and such a read can stall a frame for tens of milliseconds while the GPU and the
 * recording are normal.
 *
 * Why by range and not by block. When few of the offsets asked for are aligned to 256 KB, a block cache reads
 * several times more from the SD than is requested. Storing the exact range (file, offset, bytes) has no
 * amplification by construction: not a byte is read that the game did not ask for.
 *
 * Sizing. What repeats is usually small: requests of a few hundred KB to a couple of MB, each repeated a few times.
 * Only reads of switch_io_ranges_min_kb (256 KB) or more are kept; a 4 MB floor would see almost none of them. A
 * level load's sequential sweep (consecutive 4 MB blocks, each read once) is not stored at all (see
 * IsSweepAndAnnotate): it would only fill the LRU. The cap has to hold the whole repeating set: below it the cache is
 * not slightly worse but worthless, because entries are evicted before they are reused and nothing hits.
 *
 * The memory comes from the host heap (1,024 MB, runtime_switch.cpp), of which the guest backing and the thread
 * stacks take ~506 MB; the GPU budget is separate. 64 MB leaves margin; 128 would not in the worst case.
 *
 * The lock is not held across the disk read: it is taken to look up the table and released before going to disk.
 * The data lives in a shared_ptr, so copying it needs no lock either, and an eviction cannot free the buffer
 * another thread is reading.
 */
/*
 * The read rate of BO2's streamed image packs (.ipak).
 *
 * The game's image streaming keeps its pool full and, in a Town match, evicts and reads back the same images
 * without end: on the PC 1,700-27,000 MB per 15 s of base.ipak, every byte of it read before (the range cache above
 * serves it from RAM), with 30,000-420,000 searches of the pool allocator per 10 s (each under the game's critical
 * section 6) and the job threads putting back the jobs that wait for that section. On the 360 its disk bounded that
 * loop (an installed game reads at most ~30-40 MB/s); here a read returns at memory speed and the loop runs as fast
 * as the CPU allows. Delivering the packs at 32 MB/s (the reading thread sleeps before each read, so the rate holds
 * however the reads are split) gives the game the throughput it was made for: on the PC 3-7 MB/s are read on
 * average (the loop settles instead of spinning), 170-2,200 allocator searches per 10 s, each job worker
 * ~105 -> ~84 ms/s of CPU, the Backend ~118 -> ~91, Main ~142 -> ~121, frame times and level load time unchanged.
